# Project 3: Dictionary
For this project, you will implement a Dictionary ADT with extra functionality of being able to find the closest entries in the dictionary to the given invalid word. 
You will implement such a dictionary using a compact prefix tree. Please see a project description and a link for the starter code on Canvas.
